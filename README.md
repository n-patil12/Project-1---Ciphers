# Ciphers (CS 251: Data Structures)
# The purpose of this project is to accomplish 3 main tasks: encrypting plain text with ciphers by a constant amount, encrypting text with a key, and decrypting an encrypted text into plain text. The basis of this project is that it is using a user inputted rotation amount and a given alphabet of letters in order to produce the given response back to the user. This project handles I/O + file streams, working with string function + string parsing.
